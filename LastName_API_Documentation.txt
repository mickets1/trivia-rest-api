Each URI requires a specific HTTP-method.
If for example a GET request is used for a URI that requires POST the response is a 404.

The Postman collection gives more information about what is required and how things should work with additional comments.
(click edit on each request to show the comment).

MongoDB pluralize collections automatically, which is what we want but sometimes does this a bit weirdly.
People becomes peoples and tech becomes teches.
